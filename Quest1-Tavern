    A[???: Easy now! You wouldn't want ] --> B[Player: Who are you?]
    A --> D[Player: *You might've gotten a bit too lost this time. Run away.*]

    B --> E[Wenduag: I am the wandering huntress, Wenduag. I have spent my entire life in this here wilderness, far away from civilization.]
    E --> F[Player: Why are you here?]
    E --> G[Player *Requires Step 1 of In My Time of Need from Diane*: Diane sent me, she said you needed my help?]
    E --> H[Player: Goodbye. *Leave Wenduag.*]

    F --> I[Wenduag: Well, without me, this wilderness will keep growing with no limits. My job is to hunt the creatures in it, and to acquaint those brave enough to my wilderness.]
    G --> T[Wenduag: Oh yes... to tell you the truth, I have been lacking appearances lately, so I asked help from her to advertise my operations here... looks like it worked.]
    H --> K[Wenduag: Farewell, little one.]

    I & T --> L[Wenduag: Put simply, I have here in my hands bounties. The commonfolk give them to me, then I give them to whoever wants to try their luck hunting the animal in the bounty. Are you interested?]
    L --> M[Player: Alright, let's do it. *Accept Wilderness Bounty*]
    L --> N[Player: Actually, not right now. *Decline Wilderness Bounty*]
    L --> O[Player: What's in it for me?]

    M --> P[Wenduag: Eager, are we? Let's see here...]
    N --> Q[Wenduag: Hm. No bother, its not like the wilderness will leave anytime soon.]
    O --> R[Wenduag: Well you can't have what's on your mark that's for sure, but the clients of these bounties do offer a lot of gold if that's your thing. I say learn to do it for the thrill... hehehe.]

    D --> S[Wenduag: Heh. The stench of prey. See you again, or not.]

    P --> U[Wenduag: Alright, here's your bounty. Choose wisely, little one.]
    U --> V1[Player: I'll take the Brown Bear bounty.]
    U --> V2[Player: I'll take the Grey Wolf bounty.]
    U --> V3[Player: I'll take the Yrmania Falcon bounty.]
    U --> V4[Player: I'll take the Black Gorilla bounty.]
    U --> V5[Player: I'll take the 'Dragon' bounty.]

    V1 --> W1[Wenduag: Two Brown Bears, eh? They're tough and resistant to blunt damage, but if you've got a sharp blade or a good bow, you should be fine. Bring me their pelts, and you'll get 150GP.]
    V2 --> W2[Wenduag: Five Grey Wolves? They're not particularly resistant to anything, but don't underestimate them. Their bites can tear through armor. Bring me their fangs, and you'll get 100GP.]
    V3 --> W3[Wenduag: Yrmania Falcons? Tricky little birds. They're weak to blunt and slashing, but good luck hitting them with anything but a bow. Bring me their feathers, and you'll get 150GP.]
    V4 --> W4[Wenduag: A Black Gorilla? Now that's a challenge. They're resistant to all types of damage and hit like a boulder falling from the sky. Bring me its head, and you'll get 300GP.]
    V5 --> W5[Wenduag: Ok now that's weird, usually when the kids leave me joke bounties I just throw them out, but this one seems different. I think you should still go for it, who knows? You might be the first person in Yrmania to kill a dragon! Bring me its scales, I guess, and you'll get 500GP.]

    W1 --> X1[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept Brown Bear Bounty*]
    W2 --> X2[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept Grey Wolf Bounty*]
    W3 --> X3[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept Yrmania Falcon Bounty*]
    W4 --> X4[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept Black Gorilla Bounty*]
    W5 --> X5[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept 'Dragon' Bounty*]

    X1 --> Y1[Wenduag: Good luck, hunter. Don't let the bears make a meal out of you.]
    X2 --> Y2[Wenduag: Watch your back out there. Wolves hunt in packs.]
    X3 --> Y3[Wenduag: Those falcons are fast. Don't miss your shot.]
    X4 --> Y4[Wenduag: That gorilla's no joke. Come back in one piece, if you can.]
    X5 --> Y5[Wenduag: Listen, it's probably just a big lizard, but don't get caught unawares out there. Call for me if you need it.]

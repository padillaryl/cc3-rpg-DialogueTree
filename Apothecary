    A[You wake up with blurried vision, lying on a bed. You try looking around and see rows of beds filled with people groaning. A doctor notices that you have woken up and asks how you are feeling.
    B[???: Easy now! You wouldn't want to put more pressure on your wound.] --> B[Player: W-what happened?]

    C --> D[Apothecary: The Legion invaded, and you were injured in the attack. Luckily, someone carried you out of that nasty battle. How do you feel?]
    D --> E[Player: I feel... alright]
    D --> F[Player: I am awake as you can see.]
    D --> G[Player: *Remain Silent*]

    D --> G[Apothecary: You're lucky to feel alright. You had one of the worst injuries out of everyone. A head injury, to be precise. It's a miracle that you still live and breath.]
    E --> H[Apothecary: Hah, yes I do see it. You're lucky that you can still humor with that injury of yours. A head injury, to be precise. It's a miracle that you still live and breath.]
    F --> I[Apothecary: I know that it might be confusing, but you're lucky even with that injury. A head injury, to be precise. It's a miracle that you still live and breath.]

    G & H & I --> J[Apothecary: Serious matters aside. Pray tell, what is your name?]
    J --> K[Player: My...  name. It's...]
    
    K --> L[Apothecary: Well, *Player*, I'm going to have you to look over here.]
    L --> M[Wenduag: Hm. No bother, its not like the wilderness will leave anytime soon.]
    O --> R[Wenduag: Well you can't have what's on your mark that's for sure, but the clients of these bounties do offer a lot of gold if that's your thing. I say learn to do it for the thrill... hehehe.]

    D --> S[Wenduag: Heh. The stench of prey. See you again, or not.]

    P --> U[Wenduag: Alright, here's your bounty. Choose wisely, little one.]
    U --> V1[Player: I'll take the Brown Bear bounty.]
    U --> V2[Player: I'll take the Grey Wolf bounty.]
    U --> V3[Player: I'll take the Yrmania Falcon bounty.]
    U --> V4[Player: I'll take the Black Gorilla bounty.]
    U --> V5[Player: I'll take the 'Dragon' bounty.]

    V1 --> W1[Wenduag: Two Brown Bears, eh? They're tough and resistant to blunt damage, but if you've got a sharp blade or a good bow, you should be fine. Bring me their pelts, and you'll get 150GP.]
    V2 --> W2[Wenduag: Five Grey Wolves? They're not particularly resistant to anything, but don't underestimate them. Their bites can tear through armor. Bring me their fangs, and you'll get 100GP.]
    V3 --> W3[Wenduag: Yrmania Falcons? Tricky little birds. They're weak to blunt and slashing, but good luck hitting them with anything but a bow. Bring me their feathers, and you'll get 150GP.]
    V4 --> W4[Wenduag: A Black Gorilla? Now that's a challenge. They're resistant to all types of damage and hit like a boulder falling from the sky. Bring me its head, and you'll get 300GP.]
    V5 --> W5[Wenduag: Ok now that's weird, usually when the kids leave me joke bounties I just throw them out, but this one seems different. I think you should still go for it, who knows? You might be the first person in Yrmania to kill a dragon! Bring me its scales, I guess, and you'll get 500GP.]

    W1 --> X1[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept Brown Bear Bounty*]
    W2 --> X2[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept Grey Wolf Bounty*]
    W3 --> X3[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept Yrmania Falcon Bounty*]
    W4 --> X4[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept Black Gorilla Bounty*]
    W5 --> X5[Player: I'll get it done. *Accept 'Dragon' Bounty*]

    X1 --> Y1[Wenduag: Good luck, hunter. Don't let the bears make a meal out of you.]
    X2 --> Y2[Wenduag: Watch your back out there. Wolves hunt in packs.]
    X3 --> Y3[Wenduag: Those falcons are fast. Don't miss your shot.]
    X4 --> Y4[Wenduag: That gorilla's no joke. Come back in one piece, if you can.]
    X5 --> Y5[Wenduag: Listen, it's probably just a big lizard, but don't get caught unawares out there. Call for me if you need it.]

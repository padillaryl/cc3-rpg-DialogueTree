  A[You cornered him into an alley, both of you gasping for air. He faces at you, hunched over.]
  A --> B[Courier: Y-you... don't know... *gasp* what you're doing.]
  B --> C[You see him reach for something in his back.]
  C --> D[Courier: Listen, kid. Turn back. What you're trying to get back is something far more important than you can imagine.]
  D --> E[He slowly unsheathes something from his back.]
  E --> F[Courier: Turn around right now and tell whoever you're serving right now that you've lost this thing. Walk away from it and forget about it.]

  F --> G[Player: I can't do that. Please, give me the package.]
  F --> H[Player: I'm sorry, but that package is mine. And you're going to give it to me now.]
  F --> I[Player: Ok *Leave*]

  I --> J[What are you doing? The man who has the package, your task in the first place, is right there! You can't walk away, not here and definitely not now.]
  J --> G & H

  G --> K[Courier: Don't make me do this.]
  H --> L[Courier: You'll have to take it from me!]

  K & L --> M[He reveals two daggers and lunged forward. *Combat Scenario*]

  M --> N[He stops mid-swing, as if he hesitated to attack you. You took the chance and sweeped him from his feet. He falls over and out flies a box and a letter. The courier readies his weapons once again, but lets go both. He surrenders.]
  N --> O[Courier: Take it. I don't want to take any part in this anyway.]
  O --> P[You approach the fallen items and picked up the letter. The box, however, was damaged and beside it is a key. Is this the package you were supposed to deliver?]
  P --> Q[You picked it up and cleaned the mud off. It's strangely heavy for a key and is decorated with an emblem and words. You pocket it immediately and leave the alleyway.]

  Q --> R[Courier: Hey, before you go.]
  R --> S[You stopped and listened to the man.]
  S --> T[Courier: I can't change your mind earlier, but He can. Fort Faroth, a man who goes by Nik. Find him, and tell him 'a knight in the gallows']

  T --> U[You continue your walk away from the alley after listening to the man. Though, you feel something is amiss.]
  U --> V[Curiosity consumes you. This key, sent by the queen herself, holds something more than it looks like. Why would a key be this important? Better yet, why would anyone want it? For only a little gold? The man who was keeping it looked like they were protecting it with their life but they stopped and gave it to you in hopes of you understanding. There is certainly something going on, and you must uncover it. You set your next destination to Fort Faroth]

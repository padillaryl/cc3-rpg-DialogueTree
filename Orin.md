  ORININTRO0[???: Hello sweetmeat... welcome to my den.] --> ORININTRO0A[Player: Who are you?] & ORININTRO0B[Player: *You do not like the sound of that. Run away.*]
  ORININTRO0A --> ORININTRO1[Orin: Rushing to introductions are we? I am Lady Orin, child of our dear murder lord Bhaal... I know you've found my prose, which means we're ready to get down to business. Do you know why you're here, my sweetmeat?]
  ORININTRO1 --> ORININTRO2A[Player: Enlightnen me.] & ORININTRO2B[Player: Uhm... for you? *Romance*] & ORININTRO2C[Player: I'd rather not find out. Bye! *Run away.*]
  ORININTRO2A --> ORININTRO2A1[Orin: You are in the church of our dear murder lord Bhaal. When this war started... these pesky Thomasian church goers pointed to us and now the entire capital says they want to get rid of us! So now we have to hide in these catacombs like rats... the smell is quite an earthy tone, don't you agree? But that's not the point, the prose you have read is from me, which means you have just answered the call of my dear father himself. The question now is, are you ready to render unto him, like we have?] --> ORININTRO3A & ORININTRO3B & ORININTRO3C
  ORININTRO2B --> ORININTRO2B1[Orin: Silly little thing... we can get to personal things later... but first things first.] --> ORININTRO2A1
  ORININTRO3A[Player: Yes.] --> ORININTRO4
  ORININTRO3B[Player: Alright, if that's what you want. *Romance*] --> ORININTRO4
  ORININTRO3C[Player: Uh, no! *Run away*]

### **Stalker Svignee (Thomasian Sanctified Stalker): Darkness Befalls the Land**
- **Quest picked up at:** When Stalker Svignee confronts the player in the lone pathway after the player recovers in the capital.
- **Step 0**
  - After the player gets knocked out and carried to the capital, he comes across a small Thomasian charity event that is also acting as a medium to recruit new militiamen. Trying to get past the crowd blocking his way he will be met with Stalker Svignee, who appears as a heavily armored knight. In a menacing authoritative voice, he invites you to meet him in the Thomasian Pilgrimage Site just outside the walls of the capital. Then the player hears a commotion behind them and when they attempt to look back at Stalker Svignee, they have already vanished.

    NARRATION[As you squeeze your way slowly through the narrow pathway, you are startled to find a menacing figure clad in armour, his voice echoing through the metal of his helmet as he starts to converse with you, menacingly and authoritatively.] --> STALKER1[???: Are you lost, little one?] --> RESP1 & RESP2 & RESP3
    RESP1[Player: Who are you?] --> STALKER2[Mysterious Armoured Man: Who am I? Your only chance of survival... and purpose, after you have injured yourself so brazingly during that fight with that Legion of Ahmed... they are so cunning, are they not?] --> RESPA1[Player: I didn't see you in that fight, how do you know that?] &           RESPA2[Player: Why are you telling me this?]
    RESP2[Player: Listen, whatever you're offering, I'm not buying.] --> NARRATION2
    RESP3[Player: *This one has startled you to your very core... turn around and attempt to leave.*] --> NARRATION2[As you attempt to turn and leave, you feel a sharp object slightly pierce your back.] --> STALKER3B[Mysterious Armoured Man: Why... when the elected of Thomasia himself speaks, you shall listen... you don't want to be branded as a heretic, would you? Now listen to me...] --> STALKER3

    RESPA1 --> STALKER3A
    STALKER3A[Mysterious Armoured Man: I have my means, I assure you... now listen carefully, I will give you my offer once and only once.] --> STALKER3
    RESPA2 --> STALKER3[Mysterious Armoured Man: You have survived a grave... injury. Commoners would call that pure luck, but for a man such as me? I think there is something far greater at play... as such is your purpose to me. Maybe you have been the answer to my prayers to dear St. Thomas. Much is at stake as you can see during a strange time of hostility and conflict like this... and so here is my offer. Meet me at the Thomasian Pilgrimage Site, just outside the capital walls. There, I can give you the proper offer as well as formally introduce myself... I doubt we have met in the past.] --> NARRATION3[You hear a sudden clang of metal, as if a cooking pot crashed down from the roofs above to the ground you are standing on below. Your fright forces you to shift your eyes and head to the direction of the noise, only to see nothing there. When you move to check behind you, the mysterious armoured man is gone.]
  ```
- **Step 1**
  - When the player enters the Thomasian pilgrimage site, they are met with Stalker Svignee who tasks them with helping the pilgrims that are going to the pilgrimage site who are experiencing bullying and discrimination from the locals. Stalker heavily suggests the player to just get rid of the aggressors. Even after suggesting a more peaceful solution, Stalker will still press the player to killing or threatening off the aggressors.
  - 500GP (or the currency decided) is rewarded upon completion.

    NARRATION[You step into the boundaries of the Thomasian Pilgrimage site. You are lost in your own thoughts... what is this place? What is Thomasia? Who is that man? What does he want with you? You ponder on these questions before the mysterious armoured man appears before you once again while you were lost in your thoughts.] --> STALKER1[Stalker Svignee: Very good decision, little one... to accept my offer. Allow me to introduce myself... I am the Sanctified Stalker of Thomasia itself... Stalker Svignee. My title nor my new name doesn't matter so give it no heed, my purpose in this foreign land is to oversee the faith's operations, making sure the flock stays faithful, steadfast, and obedient.] --> RESPA[Player: *Question* Wait wait... new name?] & RESPB[Player: *Question* Why are you called Sanctified Stalker?] & RESPC[Player: So what is your offer?]
  RESPA --> RESPASTALKER[Stalker Svignee: Hm. There is nothing to gain from exhuming the past, but to satiate your curiousity, I was a man named Karabasan, from the neighbouring state of Kent. My new name is Svignee. That is all I am allowing myself to tell you.] --> RESPASTALKER1[Player: *Question* What?] --> REPASTALKER2[Stalker Svignee: What? Not content are we? Very well. I was a criminal during my life in Kent, famed as an assassin who terrorized the streets. Is that what you wanted? Don't be frightened by my history, I have converted to and been ordained by Thomasia, after all.] --> REPASTALKER3[Player: *Question* Why are you so forthcoming with that information?] --> REPASTALKER4[Stalker Svignee: And why are you so eager to dig your own grave by asking such meaningless questions?] --> NARRATION2[His voice booms in his helmet, you can feel the frustration that he is withholding within the metal, but alongside it, a touch of... joy?] --> REPASTALKER5[Stalker Svignee: No more questions, prepared to receive my offer, or should I cut our partnership early?]
  ```
- **Step 2**
  - After proving their loyalty and willingness to serve Thomasia, the Stalker tasks the player with escorting a charity caravan to the lower district from the capital. What happens is that this caravan is intercepted on the way to the lower district by slum residents that pose as bandits. Even though they will surrender after one or two of them gets defeated, Stalker will suddenly appear on the scene and ask the player to finish them off. If the player declines, Stalker does it himself.
  - 600GP (or the currency decided) and miscellaneous supplies from the caravan such as foods and drinks are rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 3 (Symbiosis: which requires acquisition and learning about the purpose of the vermin key)**
  - Stalker sends the player to Fort Faroth to acquire the aid of the army that is stationed there. He requests the player to assassinate Quartermaster Jeera and replace her with a Thomasian sympathizer.
  - Stalker's Hidden Blade, a unique dagger is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 4**
  - After solving the situation at Fort Faroth, Stalker will ask the player to ask Old Sage Nik about the true purpose of the Vermin Key, suggesting that they use force if needed. However, on the way to the room that they initially find Old Sage Nik before they acquire the Vermin Key, Stalker will already be there trying to beat the information out of him. This is where it can be revealed that the Vermin Key controlls the underground defense system of the state which is filled with ravenous rats that could consume the entire population if they wanted to. Gaining this information, Stalker Svignee's homicidal and violent tendencies are fully put in display; in contrast to the supposedly benevolent and kind faith of Thomasia.
  - Amulet of the Devout, a unique amulet that boosts HP is rewarded upon  completion.
- **Step 5 (I Am What I Am: which requires completion of Symbiosis)**
  - Right after acquiring the control or aid of Fort Faroth's army, Stalker informs the player that the rival faction of Ahmed is trying to negotiate an alliance and peace-deal with the de-facto leader of the people of the slums, King Bennett. He tasks the player with getting rid of King Bennett and his followers to crush the possibility of rebellion.
  - 750 GP (or the currency decided) and King Bennett's Armour, which is a unique armour that boosts the player's speed (and is also only obtainable this way).
- **Step 6 (Pre-finale)**
  - In preparation for the upcoming battle against Ahmed, Svignee tasks the player with gathering conscripts to fight for the Thomasian army. Svignee says that while the army provided by Borisya is great, they are still severely outnumbered and overextended even with the support of Fort Faroth. He also makes a comment about "you know, this is also a great way to get rid of some of the heretics... yes, visit the Heretic Tower first and bring them the offer of their freedom in exchange for their sword when the time comes. Also, try asking in the Lower District as well...", also urging the player to use force and intimidation if necessary. The prisoners in the Heretic Tower will be guaranteed to join but it will take some effort to convince Magistrate Ken Nough to provide some men.
  - The support of whichever men that they have chosen to conscript to the Thomasian force, as well as Karabasan's Mask, a unique armour piece that greatly boosts speed, charisma, and attacks with small weapons. When Stalker hands over Karabasan's Mask, he makes an offhand comment of how "oh letting go is so hard... no matter. Don't worry about this mask's original owner, I know him very well, and just know that he's out of the picture."

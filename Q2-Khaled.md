  A[You went to the gallows and tried to enter. A soldier stops you.]
  A --> B[Solder: Halt! What is your business here?]

  B --> C[Player: A man. More specifically, a Legionnaire. I need to ask him a few questions.]
  B --> D[Player: Just sightseeing. And maybe even asking a few questions from the main attractions.]
  B --> E[Player: Visiting someone.]

  C --> F[Soldier: You better not do anything that you'll regret. Just make it fast.]
  D --> G[Soldier: This is no circus, but make it fast.]
  E --> H[Soldier: Ah, well then. Make it fast.]

  F & G & H --> I[You enter inside the building where prisoners are being kept. It's a hallway full of locked doors with prisoners mumbling, screaming, or minding their own business. You peek them one by one, walking along the hallway until you see a robed man. His clothes are covered in mud and blood. You better hope that it's from his injuries and not someones. He immediately recognized you.]

  I --> J[???: Ahh, my savior. What may be your business here?]
  J --> K[Player: I'm here to ask if you see a letter and a package when you were carrying me back here.]
  K --> L[???: Ah, that I may not answer in full clarity. But I didn't say I was not answering it. A man, who bears an insignia, was by you when you were... Resting.]
  L --> M[You thank him and ask him if he wants to escape or not.]
  M --> N[???: My part here is not yet in play. But yours is just starting.]
  N --> O[Guards approach you and ask you to step aside. They unlocked the cell and went inside, carrying the Legionnaire out of his own cell while being constrained with various contraptions. He stops and looks at you.]
  O --> P[???: You have proven yourself worthy of the Prophet. But the question remains. Are you simply His audience, or will you be part of the grand play?]
  P --> Q[The guard punches the Legionnaire and forced him to keep walking. You leave the gallows in hopes that you will not be punched. It's much more crowded than before, though. Something may be happening.]
  Q --> R[]
